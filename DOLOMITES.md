Download the MyDolomiti App. It will give you all the instructions that you need, plus some route guidance on the slopes. It saved us once when lifts were about to close and we had no idea how to get home :')
You can also buy the SkiPass from there - you'll get a discount if you buy it online.

## ⛷️ Slopes

### 🔄 Sellaronda

Do this one on the second day. It is a lot of fun, to be done at least twice: once clockwise, once counter-clockwise. The orange (clockwise) is slightly more difficult and faster, but also more crowded. The green (counter-clockwise) is easier and more panoramic, but a bit longer and less crowded. It can take up to 6 hours if you don't rush it (but we can sprint through it in 3h), so be sure to start by 10am. It is a very nice way to explore and check out which ski area you like the most, so that you can come back there during the following days. You will go around four passes: Sella, Gardena, Campolongo, Pordoi. Be sure to reach the last one ~2h before closing, or you will be stuck.

### 🏔️ Gardena / Seiser Alm

This pass is the one with the biggest amount of slopes and areas. Here some recommendations:

- **Col Raiser:** Closest to Selva, good starter. Take the [Col Raiser](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vGH6xXgeMixgyPXH8) and go up. Keep the left and keep going up (chair lift). You can now go down the Fermeda (Red) in front of you, which is wide and long. Otherwise follow for La Longia (Red) to try one of the longest slopes in the world. Not difficult, but fun to do and with a great view.
- **Ciampinoi:** Climb up to [Ciampinoi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vmEqwmZNhB1TxwfH6) and look around. You can start with the Saslong 3 (Red or Black). It is generally exposed to the sun, so it tends to deteriorate in the afternoon. Best done in the morning. Plan del Gralba (4) tends to ruin pretty easily, if the temperature is high, so do that one too if you wanna have a quick connection to the Piz Sella area.
- **Piz Sella:** Nice slopes, not too challenging (all blue and red). A must see here is the [Città dei Sassi](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nBfmgv3PAKuWJUBN6) (literally "city of rocks", because the shapes of the rocks resemble buildings in a city-scape). It's just a flat connecting slope, but the panorama on your left is going to be breath-taking.
- **Dantercepies:** Climb up to [Dantercepies](https://maps.app.goo.gl/cdEd1yNYvK94aYdTA), wait for the second station (destination). Slopes here are red, long and fun. Generally in a good state, even in the afternoon.
- **Seiser Alm:** A bit further away. Easy slopes, great for beginners and a medium-sized snow park (if you like freestyle skiing). Can only be reached via Ortisei, so you will have to go up the Col Raiser, follow for Ortisei, and proceed into the town to the [lift](https://maps.app.goo.gl/htVb2HDPv2uo2g5z7). This is the only connection to the ski area, so plan carefully. Here you can get back with the **Pilat**, which is super pretty. Check out the weather conditions, cause it can get quite frozen.

### 🏔️ Pordoi / Val di Fassa

Great area with a lot of slopes (mostly red).

- **Belvedere:** two slopes, great landscapes. There is also a good restaurant, with the same name (check below).
- **Pordoi:** three great slopes, long and pleasant: Gherdecia (red), Col Dei Rossi (red), Sass Becé (red).
- **Diego (black):** honorable mention. It's a _real_ black slope - can be challenging, approach with care. It's rather short, but totally worth it.
- **Val di Fassa:** south from here. Only one point of connection to get back, so plan carefully. **Ciampac** is a fun one, but nothing special. Worth doing once.

### 🏔️ Arabba / Porta Vescovo / Marmolada

A bunch of very difficult slopes, oftentime frozen. You have to pass here to go to the Marmolada.

- **Fodoma (black):** extremely steep and generally quite frozen. Only for the brave of heart.
- **Marmolada**: must see at least once, when the weather is perfect. It is quite far away, so plan it properly. You have to reach Arabba, and then the [Porta Vescovo](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5nLGzygbvoVkyVDZ6) lift. Here, follow for [Marmolada](https://maps.app.goo.gl/j7gNBB6APiX342dy5) (Malga Ciapela), where you will find the lift. To get on top (Punta Rocca), you have to take three lifts one after the other. Once you reach it, go on top of the station for the landscape and be amazed (you are on an glacier, higher than any other mountain around). Take it easy with the oxygen, this is more than 3300msl.
